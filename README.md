# TypingGame
Measures your Typing speed


It generates random nonsensical words , adds them to a sentence that is as long as you choose, and then it measures your typing speed.
Stil WIP, and it will be completely reworked in the future, to have more coherent words (still random), and some algorith that gives you
letters that you do wrong more often. I'm also planning to make this into a window that reads your text as you type it, instead of a console thing
that you have to type and then press enter.
